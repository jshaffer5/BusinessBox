            <h1> Getting Started </h1>
            <p>
                We know it's not easy starting a business. Between learning state and federal laws, filing
                taxes and important documents, and simply finding customers it can be a real challenge to
                get your idea off the ground and start earning money. That's why we want to give you
                the resources you need to be successful. We'll be focusing on a few important topics to
                give you a stronger grasp of the principles needed to run your business well:
                <ul>
                    <li>Deciding what type of business suits you best</li>
                    <li>Registering your business</li>
                    <li>Finding customers and growing</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Choosing your business</h1>
            <p> Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
                The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of
                Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.</p>
